webpackJsonp([1],{335:function(e,t){e.exports="# Flux VS Single State Tree\n\nI attended the Reactive Conference in Bratislava a couple of weeks ago. I even gave a talk on [Cerebral](https://youtu.be/BfzjuhX4wJ0?t=5h44m34s) if you want to check it out. One of the questions after the talk was \"How does Cerebral relate to Redux?\". This is a difficult question to answer because they really try to solve different problems, but I would like the opportunity to answer a redefined question: \"How does Flux differ from using a single state tree?\".\n\nBy asking this I am not in a position to favor my own creation over Redux. You might say now; \"But is not Redux a single state tree?\". Yeah, it is! So what is the difference between Redux and a single state tree library like [Baobab](https://github.com/Yomguithereal/baobab)? Please read on and I will explain. I will also be answering a more fundamental question about Flux's verbosity, even in Redux. Yes, I will actually say something bad about Redux. It does not feel good, because Redux is a really great project and Dan Abramov is one of the most humble developers in the community. But I think Dan will agree that even though Redux is stated by some as the de facto standard for Flux we should still bring in new ideas and talk about how we can solve our day to day problems with different approaches.\n\nIf you have not heard of Flux before you should read up a bit on that first. I will be using [Facebook Flux](https://facebook.github.io/flux/), the [Alt](http://alt.js.org/) project and [Redux](https://github.com/rackt/redux) to explain the evolution of Flux. Then I will compare them to using a single state tree like [Baobab](https://github.com/Yomguithereal/baobab) to point out that there is a different approach.\n\n## Flux basics\nThough Flux has evolved with many different implementations there is still a core idea to Flux. I will not talk about the components, but just imagine they are the ones who triggers state changes and retrieves the current state of the application. Lets draw this up:\n\n```javascript\n\n|-----------------|                             |----------------|\n| STATE CONTAINER |<-----|                   |--| ACTION CREATOR |---<\n|-----------------|      |                   |  |----------------|\n                         |                   |\n|-----------------|      |   |------------|  |  |----------------|\n| STATE CONTAINER |<---------| DISPATCHER |<----| ACTION CREATOR |---<\n|-----------------|      |   |------------|  |  |----------------|\n                         |         ^         |\n|-----------------|      |         |         |  |----------------|\n| STATE CONTAINER |<-----|         |         |--| ACTION CREATOR |---<\n|-----------------|                |            |----------------|\n                                   |\n                                   |---------------------------------<\n\n```\n\nA *state container* is either a store or a reducer and with Flux you need to dispatch actions to these state containers. There are mainly two reasons why you do this dispatching. First of all it gives you a predictable flow. All requests for state change passes through this dispatcher and reaches all state containers. The second reason is that the action object describes a state change in your application without actually doing it. That means this description can be stored. If you reset the state of your application and run these stored state change descriptions you will bring your application back into the exact same state (time travel debugging).\n\n### Store / Reducer\nYou need a place to contain your state. The initial release of Flux calls these state containers **stores**. They are typically created with a plain object, like:\n\n```javascript\n\nconst TodosStore = {\n  isSaving: false,\n  list: []\n};\n```\n\nWith **Alt** this was turned into a class:\n\n```javascript\n\nclass TodosStore {\n  constructor() {\n    this.isSaving = false;\n    this.list = [];\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAnd with **Redux** we use a function, called a reducer. How reducers differ is that you return state changes instead of mutating the existing state. We use the [ImmutableJS](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/) project to create our initial state and we will continue to use this library to change our state in the Redux examples below.\n\n```javascript\n\nimport Immutable from 'immutable';\n\nconst initialState = Immutable.fromJS({\n  isSaving: false,\n  list: []  \n});\n\nfunction TodosReducer(state = initialState, action) {\n  return state;\n}\n```\n\nSo all these abstractions has the same purpose. They store state. The way they differ is how you act upon actions and change the state. Lets talk about actions first.\n\n### Actions\nWith traditional Flux you use a **switch** statement and we check the *action type* to act on an action. This means that all actions reaches all stores:\n\n```javascript\n\nimport dispatcher from './dispatcher';\n\nconst TodosStore = {\n  isSaving: false,\n  list: []\n};\n\nTodosStore.dispatchToken = dispatcher.register((payload) => {\n  switch (payload.actionType) {\n    case 'SAVING_TODO':\n      TodosStore.isSaving = true;\n      break;\n    case 'ADD_TODO':\n      TodosStore.list.push(payload.todo);\n      break;\n    case 'SAVED_TODO':\n      TodosStore.isSaving = false;\n      break;\n  }\n});\n```\n\nWith **Alt** you actually wire the specific actions to the store. The switch statement is often seen as a verbose construct, and with good reason, it is :-) We will look at the actions implementation in the next section, but this is how you would wire it up inside the store:\n\n```javascript\n\nimport TodosActions from './TodosActions';\n\nclass TodosStore {\n  constructor() {\n    this.isSaving = false;\n    this.list = [];\n\n    this.bindListeners({\n      handleSavingTodo: TodosActions.SAVING_TODO,\n      handleAddTodo: TodosActions.ADD_TODO,\n      handleSavedTodo: TodosActions.SAVED_TODO\n    });\n  }\n  handleSavingTodo() {\n    this.isSaving = true;\n  }\n  handleAddTodo(todo) {\n    this.list.push(todo);\n  }\n  handleSavedTodo() {\n    this.isSaving = false;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWith **Redux** and a reducer you move back to using switch statements. Notice how we use Immutable JS to return completely new state from the reducer.\n\n```javascript\n\nimport Immutable from 'immutable';\n\nconst initialState = Immutable.fromJS({\n  isSaving: false,\n  list: []  \n});\n\nfunction TodosReducer(state = initialState, action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case SAVING_TODO:\n      return state.set('isSaving', true);\n    case ADD_TODO:\n      return state.updateIn(['list'], list => list.push(action.todo));\n    case SAVED_TODO:\n      return state.set('isSaving', false);\n  }\n  return state;\n}\n```\n\n### Action creators\nThe initial Flux implementation and Redux allows you to dispatch actions directly to stores/reducers, though very often you need an action creator. An action creator is a function that will do multiple dispatches to the stores. This is often related to asynchronous operations, like talking to the server.\n\nWith traditional Flux:\n\n```javascript\n\nimport dispatcher from './dispatcher';\nimport ajax from 'ajax';\n\nexport default function addTodo(todo) {\n  dispatcher.dispatch({actionType: 'SAVING_TODO'});\n  ajax.post('/todos', todo)\n    .then(() => {\n      dispatcher.dispatch({actionType: 'SAVED_TODO'});\n      dispatcher.dispatch({actionType: 'ADD_TODO', todo: todo});\n    });\n}\n```\n\nWith **Alt** you always have to use an action creator.\n\n```javascript\n\nimport ajax from 'ajax';\n\nexport default {\n  savingTodo() {\n    this.dispatch();\n  }\n  addTodo(todo) {\n    this.actions.savingTodo();\n    ajax.post('/todos', todo)\n      .then(() => {\n        this.actions.savedTodo();\n        this.dispatch(todo);\n      });\n  }\n  savedTodo() {\n    this.dispatch();\n  }\n};\n```\n\nAnd with **Redux** you also create functions, though you dispatch that function. This function receives the dispatch allowing it to use it multiple times:\n\n*saveTodo.js*\n```javascript\n\nimport ajax from 'ajax';\n\nexport function addTodo() {\n  return (dispatch) => {\n    dispatch({type: 'SAVING_TODO'});\n    ajax.post('/todos', todo)\n      .then(() => {\n        dispatch({type: 'SAVED_TODO'});\n        dispatch({\n          type: 'ADD_TODO',\n          todo: todo\n        });\n      });    \n  };\n};\n```\n\n### Comparing Redux with a single state tree\nSo now we have taken a look at how Flux works. I indicated early in this article that **Redux** differs from a typical state tree. The reason I state that is because you do not define a Redux app as a single state tree, you define the branches separately in reducers and then you attach the branches later. You might say, \"what is the difference?\". Readability. This is the first part of what makes Redux, and Flux in general, less readable than a typical single state tree. Like our example above:\n\n```javascript\n\nimport todos from './reducers/todos';\n\n{\n  todos\n}\n```\n\nBut the tree really looks like this:\n\n```javascript\n\n{\n  todos: {\n    list: [],\n    isSaving: false\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWith Redux you do not describe the tree as a whole, but that is one of the greatest benefits of a single state tree. You can just read it and understand the complete state of your application. So let us look more into a tree that is defined and operated on as a whole, like [Baobab](https://github.com/Yomguithereal/baobab).\n\n```javascript\n\nimport Baobab from 'baobab';\n\nconst tree = new Baobab({\n  todos: {\n    isLoading: false,\n    list: []\n  }\n})\n```\n\nSo this is actually all we need when defining a Baobab tree. We create the tree by passing the object representing all the state. We do not split it into multiple state containers. If we want more state we just add it to this single object. With very big applications you might decide to split the tree into multiple \"applications\", but you will still be able to read all the state of the specific \"application\" as a whole.\n\nBut how do we act upon dispatched actions? Well, when you represent all the state in your application as one state container you do not need a dispatcher and actions. There is only one place to go and that is the Baobab tree. And it is still as predictable as traditional Flux.\n\nBut what about the switch statements, we have to change the state of the tree! With a Baobab tree you do not need to define custom state changing logic, you have an API to change the state.\n\nBut what about immutability then? You actually do not have to use a reducer to allow immutability, Baobab is also immutable. Think of the tree as always being the same and when you create it, `new Baobab({})`, you pass the first branch, sitting on the top of the tree. That branch can have more branches and so it grows.\n\nSo imagine our tree as:\n\n```javascript\n\nisSaving  list\n     \\     /\n      \\   /\n       \\ /\n      todos\n          \\---/\n          |   |\n          |   | <- Tree\n          |___|\n\n```\nWhen we make a change to a branch, like `tree.set(['todos', 'isSaving'], false)`, it will break the whole branch off the tree and also break off any other joined branches, in this case the *list* branch:\n\n```javascript\n\nisSaving         list\n     \\            /\n      \\          /\n       \\        /\n      todos\n                \\---/\n                |   |\n                |   | <- Tree\n                |___|\n\n```\n\nNow it replaces the branch we changed with a completely new one and then it reattaches the list branch.\n\n```javascript\n\n (false)      (true)\nisSaving    isSaving   list\n     \\           \\      /\n      \\           \\    /\n       \\           \\  /\n      todos       todos\n                      \\---/\n                      |   |\n                      |   | <- Tree\n                      |___|\n\n```\n\n\nWhat this boils down to is that you do not need a dispatcher and actions with a single state tree, and you change the state of the tree with imperative programming. An example being: `tree.set(['todos', 'isSaving'], true)`. You might have heard that imperative programming is out and the new thing is functional programming. And yeah, it is really great to see all the projects evolving around functional programming, but that does not mean you should never do imperative programming. It is all about the right tool for the job. And if you think about it, with Redux and Immutable JS you do a lot of imperative programming.\n\n#### Tree basics\nSo let us move back to the beginning of this article and look at how the state changes occur with a single state tree.\n\n```javascript\n\n             |----------|\n          |--| FUNCTION |\n          |  |----------|\n          |\n|------|  |  |----------|\n| TREE |<----| FUNCTION |\n|------|  |  |----------|\n          |\n          |  |----------|\n          |--| FUNCTION |\n             |----------|\n```\n\nThere is no dispatcher and no actions. We just have normal functions that changes the state of the tree.\n\n#### Defining the tree\nI already showed you this, but let us recap. To create the state of our application we:\n\n```javascript\n\nimport Baobab from 'baobab';\n\nexport default new Baobab({\n  todos: {\n    isSaving: false,\n    list: []\n  }\n});\n```\n\nAgain, we do not split our state definition into different files and create logic for changing the state. We just describe it \"as is\".\n\n#### Actions and action creators\nSince there are no actions using a single state tree you do not really need action creators either. What you need though is to change the state of the state tree. And the way you do that is:\n\n```javascript\n\nimport tree from './tree';\nimport ajax from 'ajax';\n\nfunction addTodo(todo) {\n  tree.set(['todos', 'isSaving'], true);\n  ajax.post('/todos', todo)\n    .then(() => {\n      tree.set(['todos', 'isSaving'], false);\n      tree.push(['todos'], todo);\n    });\n}\n```\n\nWith a single state tree like **Baobab** you use imperative programming to do your state changes, just like you do normally in JavaScript. The tree is still immutable though, so any changes to the branches of the tree will replace the whole branch, not just the value on the branch. This makes it possible to do shallow checking of values when rendering React components, making it super fast.\n\nNotice the difference here. We only have **one** construct defining how our application changes its state. We do not have two different constructs, where one defines the async operations (action creator) and an other defines the sync changes (store/reducer). This is really important. This is the second part of how readability of your code is reduced compared to a single state tree like **Baobab**.\n\n### Getting back what we lost\nYou might say now that the function above is horrible to test or you can not get time travel with this approach. And yeah, you are right. But if you imagine this state tree being your database and you watch this video [Turning the database inside out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fU9hR3kiOK0), you will quickly realize that it is not the database itself that needs to handle these features, it is a transaction layer in front of it.\n\nOne such layer is [cerebral](http://christianalfoni.com/cerebral) and it is functional. With Cerebral you use a functional approach to define the flow of state changes in your application. And this is where the functional approach shines over imperative approach:\n\n```javascript\n\nconst items = [{title: 'foo', isAwesome: true}, {title: 'bar', isAwesome: false}];\n\n// functional\nconst isAwesome = (item) => item.isAwesome;\nconst byTitle = (item) => item.title;\n\nconst awesomeItemTitles = items.filter(isAwesome).map(byTitle);\n\n// imperative\nconst awesomeItemTitles = [];\nitems.forEach((item) => {\n  if (item.isAwesome) {\n    awesomeItemTitle.push(item.title);\n  }\n});\n```\n\nWhen defining flow the functional approach gives you something powerful. It gives you the power to describe what is happening to you application in great detail, without the verbosity of implementation details. The line `items.filter(isAwesome).map(byTitle)` tells you what happens, but the imperative example requires you to read all the implementation details to understand it. This might not make much sense with such a simple example, but you would be surprised how quickly it becomes beneficial.\n\nWith [Cerebral](http://www.christianalfoni.com/cerebral) you get the same kind of functional flow, though it allows you to build more complex flows like combining asynchronous flows with synchronous flows, parallel asynchronous flows and even conditional flows. This is the problem space Cerebral tries to solve. Expressing the flow of state changes in your application. And since the functions you are referencing in this flow just operates on its argument you get the testability you want. And yes, you even get time travel debugging.\n\nSo I have been talking about approaching different problems with different tools, so lets do an experiment where we want to search something:\n\nWe do a functional reactive approach to events.\n```javascript\n\nObservable.fromEvent(input, 'change')\n  .debounce(200)\n  .map((event) => {value: event.target.value})\n  .forEach(this.props.signals.inputChanged);\n```\n\nA functional approach to define complex state changes.\n```javascript\n\nsignal('inputChanged', [\n  setInputValue,\n  setLoadingResult,\n  [\n    getResult, {\n      success: [setResult],\n      error: [setResultError]\n    }\n  ],\n  unsetLoadingResult\n])\n```\n\nAnd an imperative approach to actually change our state values.\n```javascript\n\nfunction setInputValue(input, state) {\n  state.set(['currentValue'], input.value);\n}\n```\n\nThis example can of course easily be solved with only one class of programming, it being FRP, functional or imperative. But it is when our applications grow and has to handle XXX times the complexity shown here we start to see each of these approaches has their downsides in terms of readability.\n\n### Summary\nThere are many things happening in the JavaScript community now and functional programming and functional reactive programming is really starting to get a foothold. That is great! That said, functional concepts does not necessarily mean better in all scenarios. We have been doing imperative programming for a long time, for better and worse and there are features of the imperative style that is completely lost when replaced by functional approaches. In my opinion, one of those features is readability of defining and changing state in your application.\n\nI would also like to mention that there are other differences between Redux and Baobab, like Cursors and Monkeys, which would also be interesting comparisons. But this article wanted to make a point on readability, which I hope it did.\n\nThanks for reading and please comment if you completely disagree with me, you think I am completely wrong about this or if you can relate to the statements made.\n"}});
