An experiment building a framework that understood the application it was running. A framework that would free your from getting lost building mental images of how the application works, rather letting you explore a graphical representation of all the state, state changes, side effects, renders and ultimately how all of them relate. With Cerebral 2 the experiment has matured into a framework that truly stands out in the JS jungle.","file":"2017_03_20_Cerebral-2.md","url":"/articles/2017_03_20_Cerebral-2"},{"year":2016,"month":11,"date":10,"published":1478732400000,"title":"Debugging a baby","isDraft":true,"description":"As a JavaScript developer I feel blessed being comfortable with runtime exceptions.

Readable, declarative, composable and testable are all terms related to writing good code. Often pure functions is referred to as the solution, but writing web applications is mostly about side effects and complex asynchronous flows, concepts that are inherently impure. This article will explain a concept that allows us to inherit all these great attributes of pure functions and still embrace side effects and complex asynchronous flows.","file":"2016_09_11_The-case-for-function-tree.md","url":"/articles/2016_09_11_The-case-for-function-tree"},{"year":2016,"month":6,"date":10,"published":1465509600000,"title":"Why we dropped immutability","isDraft":true,"description":"In this article I will talk about the story of why Cerebral went from forcing immutability and then later decided to let the developer choose between two sets of features instead.","file":"2016_06_10_Why-we-dropped-immutability.md","url":"/articles/2016_06_10_Why-we-dropped-immutability"},{"year":2016,"month":4,"date":27,"published":1461708000000,"title":"Combining React with industrial design","isDraft":false,"description":"In the world of web applications it is not enough to just write code. We also need a well thought out interface for our users to interact with the application. The web has changed a lot the last few years as we have moved from building static websites to full fledged complex applications. The workflow of writing code, collaborating with designers and push great products out the door is still changing as we explore this brave new world. In this article I am going to tell you about a collaboration where the designer treats the developer as a manufacturer of components, and how this idea can make very happy developers and designers.","file":"2016_04_27_Combining-React-with-industrial-design.md","url":"/articles/2016_04_27_Combining-React-with-industrial-design"},{"year":2016,"month":4,"date":6,"published":1459893600000,"title":"CycleJS driven by state","isDraft":false,"description":"So [CycleJS](http://cycle.js.org/), created by André Staltz, is an interesting project.
